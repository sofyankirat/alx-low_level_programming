script 1: Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
The program should return 0
script 2: Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code
script 3: Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code
script 4: Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Returns 1 if c is lowercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islower to learn more.
script 5: Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isalpha. Run man isalpha to learn more.
