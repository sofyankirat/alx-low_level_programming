script 1: Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
The program should return 0
script 2: Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code
script 3: Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code
script 4: Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
Prototype: int _islower(int c);
Returns 1 if c is lowercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: islower. Run man islower to learn more.
script 5: Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
Prototype: int _isalpha(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a letter, lowercase or uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isalpha. Run man isalpha to learn more.
script 6: Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
Prototype: int print_sign(int n);
Returns 1 and prints + if n is greater than zero
Returns 0 and prints 0 if n is zero
Returns -1 and prints - if n is less than zero
script 7: Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
Prototype: int _abs(int);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: abs. Run man abs to learn more.
script 8: Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
Prototype: int print_last_digit(int);
Returns the value of the last digit
script 9: Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
Prototype: void jack_bauer(void);
You can listen to this soundtrack while coding :)
script 10: Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
Prototype: void times_table(void);
Format: see example
script 11: Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result.
Prototype: int add(int, int);
script 12: Write a function that prints all natural numbers from n to 98, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void print_to_98(int n);
Numbers must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
Numbers should be printed in order
The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
The last printed number should be 98
You are allowed to use the standard library
script 13: Write a function that prints the n times table, starting with 0.
Prototype: void print_times_table(int n);
If n is greater than 15 or less than 0 the function should not print anything
Format: see example
