script 1: Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
Prototype: void _puts_recursion(char *s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: puts. Run man puts to learn more.
script 2: Write a function that prints a string in reverse.
Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);
script 3: Write a function that returns the length of a string.
Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strlen. Run man strlen to learn more.
script 4: Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.
Prototype: int factorial(int n);
If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error
Factorial of 0 is 1
script 5: Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
Prototype: int _pow_recursion(int x, int y);
If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1
FYI: The standard library provides a different function: pow. Run man pow to learn more.
script 6: Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
Prototype: int _sqrt_recursion(int n);
If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1
FYI: The standard library provides a different function: sqrt. Run man sqrt to learn more.
