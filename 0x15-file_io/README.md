Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
All your files should end with a new line.
You are not allowed to use global variables.
No more than 5 functions per file.
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden unless stated othewise.
Allowed syscalls: read, write, open, close.
You are allowed to use _putchar.
The main.c files are used to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo.
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h.
All your header files should be include guarded.
Tip: always prefer using symbolic constants (POSIX) vs numbers when it makes sense. For instance read(STDIN_FILENO, ... vs read(0, ....
Project Description

How to use the I/O system calls pen, close, read and write. What are and how to use the flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR. What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call. What is a system call. What is the difference between a function and a system call.
