Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl.
All your files should end with a new line.
You are not allowed to use global variables.
No more than 5 functions per file.
You are allowed to use the standard library.
The main.c files are used to test your functions, but you donâ€™t have to push them to your repo.
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called hash_tables.h.
All your header files should be include guarded.
Project Description
Learn about what is a hash function. What makes a good hash function. What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them. What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table. What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables. What are the most common use cases of hash tables.

0. >>> ht = {} - Write a function that creates a hash table. - 0-hash_table_create.c.
1. djb2 - Write a hash function implementing the djb2 algorithm. - 1-djb2.c.
2. key -> index - Write a function that gives you the index of a key. - 2-key_index.c.
3. >>> ht['betty'] = 'cool' - Write a function that adds an element to the hash table. - 3-hash_table_set.c.
4. >>> ht['betty'] - Write a function that retrieves a value associated with a key. - 4-hash_table_get.c.
5. >>> print(ht) - Write a function that prints a hash table. - 5-hash_table_print.c.
6. >>> del ht - Write a function that deletes a hash table. - 6-hash_table_delete.c.
7. $ht['Betty'] = 'Cool' - Rewrite the previous functions using the given data structures. - 100-sorted_hash_table.c.
